An experimental tool that can generate a complete set of strongly-typed published content models for Umbraco 6.2+ to be used in the MVC views. Either from the Umbraco UI, from the command line, or from Visual Studio.

DISCLAIMER: THIS CODE IS UNSTABLE AND FOR INFO ONLY !! IT RUNS ON A MODIFIED 6.2.0 UMBRACO SO IT WILL EVEN NOT COMPILE ON THE STOCK CODE FROM UMBRACO'S REPO

But, time will come...
