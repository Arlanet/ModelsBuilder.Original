BUILDING

Simply building the solution (in Visual Studio) either in Debug or Release does NOT build any package.

  TODO: ensure it's true

In order to build the NuGet packages, the Umbraco package, and the VSIX package,
use the build.ps1 Powershell script:

To build version 1.2.3.45 (aka release 1.2.3)
build.ps1 1.2.3 45

To build version 1.2.3.45 beta001 (aka pre-release 1.2.3-beta001)
build.ps1 1.2.3 45 beta001

The "45" number should be incremented each time we release, so that
version 1.2.3-beta001 has assemblies with version 1.2.3.45
version 1.2.3-beta002 has assemblies with version 1.2.3.46
version 1.2.3 (final) has assemblies with version 1.2.3.47

  TODO: not building the VSIX nor the Umbraco packages at the moment
