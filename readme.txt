ZpqrtBnk Umbraco Models Builder
Copyright (C) Pilotine - ZpqrtBnk 2013
Distributed under the MIT license


An experimental tool that can generate a complete set of
strongly-typed published content models for Umbraco 6.2+
to be used in the MVC views. Either from the Umbraco UI,
from the command line, or from Visual Studio.

DISCLAIMER: THIS CODE IS UNSTABLE AND FOR INFO ONLY !!

It runs on a modified 6.2.0 Umbraco version so it will
*not* compile on the stock code from Umbraco's repo.


Status
------
All tests are working
Visual Studio custom tool is working
Cannot sign assemblies because Umbraco itself is not signed
Is this going to be an issue?

Todo
----
Generate multiple files
Clear files before generating
Use the .generated.cs extension
Configure connection string, version...
